<h1>Timer for KIM UNO</h1>
<p>I've started building these files in the a65 assembler.</p>
<p>The mos file is similar to an Intel Hex file, but in paper tape format.  Use the "L" command in the KIM-1 terminal monitor, and paste the contents of the file at 0200h.  Be sure to set your character and line delays.  I set mine at 10ms and 250ms.</p>
