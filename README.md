# KIM-1_Clones
In this repository, I will store programs that I've created for the KIMUNO, and the PAL-1 Clones of the KIM-1 6502 computer.  In general, the programs for each type of clone are interchangeable with some minor modifications.<p>
The KIMUNO is a clone that is based on the Arduino Pro Mini microcontroller.  You can find more information on this clone at <a href="https://obsolescence.wixsite.com/obsolescence/kim-uno-summary-c1uuh">this link.</a><p>
The PAL-1 is a closer clone of the KIM-1 computer using an actual 6502 processor.  I purchased mine from Tindie.
